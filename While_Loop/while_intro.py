# While Loop has a similar working progress to if statement with a
# little twist to it.
# The twist for a while is block of code in the while gets executed
# over and over again until given boolExp for while become False.
# Therefore given condition for a while loop SHOULD be
# UPDATED in the WHILE LOOP BODY.
# In this simplest form, a while loop can be explained as follows:
#Check the condition.
# If the condition is true, execute the code inside the loop.
# Go back to step 1.

# Let's print the numbers from 1 to 10

# What condition can I even provide for counting?
# I would create a integer variable then
# I woul increase this number through out the loop body
# As a condition I would check this variables relation with number 10
# because the question asks me to not go over 10.

count = 1
while count <= 10 :
    print(count) #1
     # I would increase the value of count
    count += 1
