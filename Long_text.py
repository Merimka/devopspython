# String Type


# For example:
# Hi,
#I hope this email finds you well.
#I was wondering about our agreement.



print('''Hi,
I hope this email finds you well.
I was wondering about our agreement.''')

#Unlike other programming languages when we
#have multiline string we have to define in
#triple quotes (""" or ''').


print('''Display this line''')
