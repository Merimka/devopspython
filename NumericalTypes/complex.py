#What are complex numbers?
#Complex numbers consist of two parts, real and imaginary part.


# 3 root of -1 in python represented by a letter j
#To create a complex number
c = 2 + 4j

# This would be complex number

# To get the imaginary part of this variable
print(c.imag) # -> 4

# To get the real part of this
