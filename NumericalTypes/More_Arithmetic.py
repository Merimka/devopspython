# What happens when you don't want't to get the decimal point after a 
#division

# in a work environment you have 30 virtual machine that you want
# 4 devops to maintain. Can you equally divide these virtual machines
# among devops engineers.

#We can't say 1 devops engineee is goint to get 7.5 virtual machine.
#We can use floor division operator which will get rid of the 
#decimal point for us.
# Floor division operator -> //

print(a//b) #7


#Remainder(Modulus) Operator -> % ###kalan sayi 

print (41 % 6) #5

print(11 % 4) #3

print(3 % 4) #3

#Find what is left after the floor division operator.
# If the left side of % is smaller than right side the answer will be number on the left.
