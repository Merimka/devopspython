# We need to create a program that will help us to calculate
#average exam score of a student.
#We are given three variables as exam1,exam2 and exam3.
#Calculate average score for a student.
#70,40,97
# To solve this question assign multiple variables in single line.

exam1,exam2,exam3 = 70,40, 97
average_score =(exam1+exam2+exam3)/3
print(average_score)


#Problem
# In the line below I am printing the avg score however there is
# nothing the output that indicates that.
#The average exam score is 69
print("The average exam score is",average_score)

#In order to print multiple variables in single line we can use
#comma in between the variables.
#Whenever we use, to print multiple variables in sinle line
#comma adds space in between the variables.

new_variable = "The average exam score is" +str(average_score)
