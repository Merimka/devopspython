# For loop will allow us to get each element from objects(iterable)
#
# Let's print each letter from given string.
#


for variable in "Techtorial":
    print(variable)

#for variable in 123456:
    #print(variable)


# Since the integer object is not an iterable object,
# we can't use for loop with integer in format above
