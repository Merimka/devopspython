1. Ask the user to enter a random word using input function.
2. Then ask the user to input the number of letters that word consists of.
3. Lastly ask the user for a letter that they want to learn its index.
4. Your code should print True if the user entered a right number of letters in
the word. Print False if the wrong number is entered.
5. Your code should print the index of the entered letter, if the word doesnâ€™t
contain the letter then the code should print -1.
6. Please look at the example output below to understand how your code
should work.
