"""
Write the program to display the letter in following format. 
The letter should include your name and address on the console.
Your output should look something like on the next page.
Frequently Asked Questions:
1- Does my letter have to look exactly like yours?
No, but it does have to look roughly like a letter, including the 
box around the outside and the stamp.
2- Do I have to use my real address?
Of course not. But make sure your fake address takes up three lines.
3- How to I get a | to show up on the screen?
The | character is called a "pipe". Assuming you are using a 
normal US keyboard, it is Shift + backslash (\). 
The backslash key is usually located between the 
Backspace and Enter keys.
