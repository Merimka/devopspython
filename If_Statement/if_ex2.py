# getting ticket for speed violation
#   in state of IN, speed limit on HighWays is 70
#   in other states, speed limit on Highways is 55
#   -if driver exceeds speed limit for up to 10% of the limit in each state, 
#    we will give WARNING in that state
#     state of IN warning means --> print --> "YELLOW WARNING"
#     other state warnings mean --> print --> "CITATION"
# -if driver exceeds speed limit more than 10% of the limit in each state,
#  we will give TICKET in that state
#     state of IN ticket means --> print --> "$150 and 5 points"
#     other state ticket means --> print --> "$100"
# -if speed is same as  speed limit or lower, --> print --> "You are driving safe!"
#NOTE SL -> Speed Limit
## State they are in
## Compare driver's speed with more than speed limit.
## If they are going lower than SL print going safe
## If they are faster than SL we should check if they are going up to 10 percent or more
## If it is more than even up to 10 percent we should print ticket otherwise give warning.
